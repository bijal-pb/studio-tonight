    <p><h3>3. Legal Basis for Processing (For EEA Users)</h3></p>
    <p>If you are an individual in the European Economic Area (EEA), we collect and process information about you only where we have legal basis for doing so under applicable EU laws.  The legal basis depends on the services you use and how you use them. This means we collect and use your information only where:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We need it to provide you services to you, including to provide customer support and personalized features and to protect the safety and security of the services;</li>
        <li>It satisfies a legitimate interest (which is not overridden by your data protection interests), such as to market and promote our services, for research and development and to protect our legal rights and interests;</li>

        <li>We need to process your data to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h3>4. Who We May Share Your Information With</h3></p>
    <p>We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the app and our e-mail services and processing inquiries. We may provide Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties. Ripe App will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on Ripe App’s behalf. </p>
    <p>Ripe App will not sell or share your Personal Information with any third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
    <p>We reserve the right to disclose your information as required by law, and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with any applicable judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.</p>

    <p><h3>5. Children’s Privacy</h3></p>
    <p>The app is not intended for use by children under 13. If we become aware that we have unknowingly collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will make commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.</p>
    

    <p><h3>6. Advertisements and Links to Other Websites</h3></p>
    <p>The app may contain links, content, and advertisements from third parties. Such links, content, and advertisements are not endorsements, authorizations or representations of our affiliation with that third party. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third parties, and we encourage you to carefully review the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>

    <p><h3>7. Information Security and Storage</h3></p>
    <p>We use data hosting service providers in the United Kingdom to host the information we collect, and we use technical measures to secure your data.  While we implement safeguards designed to protect your information, no security system is impenetrable and due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that data, during transmission through the Internet or while stored on our systems or otherwise in our care, is absolutely safe from intrusion by others. </p>

    <p><h3>8. Retention of Data</h3></p>
    <p>Ripe App will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
    <p>Ripe App will also retain usage data for internal analysis purposes. Usage data is generally retained for a shorter period of time, except when this data is used to strengthen the security or to improve the functionality of the app, or we are legally obligated to retain this data for longer time periods.</p>

    <p><h3>9. How You Can Access the Information We Have About You</h3></p>
    <p>You have the right to access, update, and correct inaccuracies in certain information in our custody and control, subject to certain exceptions prescribed by law. You may request access, updating and corrections of inaccuracies in the personal information we have in our custody or control by emailing us. We may request certain personal information for the purposes of verifying your identity when requesting access to or correction of your personal information records. If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our Service, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by emailing us. EU data subjects may be entitled to additional rights as described below.</p>

    <p><h3>10. European Union Data Subjects</h3></p>
    <p>The General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”) affords additional rights to EU data subjects. Those rights include the right to complain to EU Supervisory Authorities and the right to access, correct, port to another party and delete certain personal data processed by Ripe App.</p>
    <p>With respect to EU data subjects, personal data includes pseudonymous information such as an IP address, a mobile advertising ID or a cookie ID. Where Ripe App is a processor of data, the legal basis will be both legitimate interest and consent depending on the type of information subject to processing. Where we rely upon legitimate interest, we have assessed the processing is not high risk and will not violate fundamental human rights of EU data subjects.</p>
    <p>Where Ripe App receives from an EU data subject a request to cease processing of data, Ripe App will stop all data processing unless such processing is required by law.</p>
    <p>If you’re an EU data subject and believe Ripe App is processing your pseudonymous information or your contact information and you wish to exercise your right to access, delete, port or remove such information, please send an email and we will respond to your request within 30 days.</p>

    <p><h3>11. Data Protection Rights Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h3></p>
    <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. If you wish to be informed what Personal Data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The right to access, update or to delete the information we have on you.</li>

            You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your Personal Data. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
